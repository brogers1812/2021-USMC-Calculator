<h4>5/21/2021</h4>
<p>
    <li>  Completed all CSV lookup tables.
    <li>  Added quality assurance folder to record data input/output accuracy (continous testing)
    <li>  Program is completed.
</p>
<h4>Way Ahead</h4>
<p>
    <li>  Continue researching in accounting for runtime to next highest minute
    <li>  Develop for website implementation
    <li>  Test for bugs
</p>
<h4>5/20/2021</h4>
<p>
    <li>  Completed all CSV tables except 5000 meter row. 
    <li>  Push ups and pullup scores account for either one and male or female choice.
    <li>  Quite a few more updates since May 18th.
</p>
<h5>Way Ahead</h5>
<p>
    <li>  Create the 5000 meter row scoresheets
    <li>  Update code to reflect male or female input for scoring crunches
    <li>  Begin research in accounting for runtime to next highest minute
</p>
<h4>5/18/2021</h4>
<p>
    <li> Removed functions to shorten code and remove reduncacy.
    <li> Created table to lookup male run times without altitude consideration. 
    <li> Inputted user input for run times. Round.up to the nearest tenth.
</p>
<h5>Way Ahead</H5>
<p>
    <li> Round times (26:52) to 27:00 and not 26:60. 
    <li> Compute a total score for a male performing pullups, crunches, and a run time. 
    <li> Consider the code to implement female scores (if/else).
</p>      
<H4>5/17/2021</h4>
<p>
    <li>  Wrote code to receive input for age, gender, high altitude, and pullups.
    <li>  Created table to lookup pullups for males.
    <li>  Program provides output of pullup score for males.
</p>
<h5>Way Ahead</h5>
<p>
    <li>  Test for bugs.
    <li>  Find solution if input is out of bounds on table. 
    <li>  Begin coding for male crunches.
</p>

<H4>5/15/2021</h4>
<p>This program will be designed to calculate PFT & CFT scores based on users input. It will be divided into categories such as Male/Female, Age, Altitude, Pullups, Crunches, Planks, and etc...</p>
