<p>
    <li> Removed functions to shorten code and remove reduncacy.
    <li> Created table to lookup male run times without altitude consideration. 
    <li> Inputted user input for run times. Round.up to the nearest tenth
<h5> Way Ahead</H5>
    <li> Round times (26:52) to 27:00 and not 26:60. 
    <li> Compute a total score for a male performing pullups, crunches, and a run time. 
    <li> Consider the code to implement female scores (if/else)
        
<H4>5/17/2021</h4>
<p>
    <li>	Wrote code to receive input for age, gender, high altitude, and pullups.
    <li>  Created table to lookup pullups for males.
    <li>  Program provides output of pullup score for males.
</p>

<h5>Way ahead</h5>
<p>
    <li>  Test for bugs
    <li>  Find solution if input is out of bounds on table. 
    <li>  Begin coding for male crunches.
</p>

<H4>5/15/2021</h4>
<p>This program will be designed to calculate PFT & CFT scores based on users input. It will be divided into categories such as Male/Female, Age, Altitude, Pullups, Crunches, Planks, and etc...</p>
